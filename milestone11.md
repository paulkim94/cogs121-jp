Paul Kim:
- Created list of locations in sidebar. Implemented a function that populates
the sidebar with data from a JSON file. Each location box shows the name,
price, category, and address currently.
- Added tabs to the sidebar, one for the places in San Diego and the other for
places that the user saves. When the user clicks on either tab, it shows the
corresponding places
- Implemented basic save/remove feature. When the user clicks the Save button
for a location in the list, it gets appended to the Saved Places section. When
the user clicks the Remove button for a saved location, it gets removed from
the Saved Places section.
- The screenshots below show the sidebar that I worked on.

Anthony Grandle:
- Added filter checkboxes that filter the markers based off of price. Implemented
a function that is able to parse all the markers and flilter out markers that
don't fit the requirements set by unchecking certain price checkboxes.
- Redesigned the filter section (categories and prices) to be both more visually
appealing and take up less room above the map
- Implemented a function (That will be apparent on next milestone) that prints
both the websiteURL and images for each location after they are clicked on the
sidebar.
- The screenshots below show the filter boxes that were redesigned as well as
the price filters in action. The second screenshot shows the code I wrote for
the image and websiteURL that will be implemented by the next milestone.

Judd Gatbonton:
- Debugged scrolling in pages. A blue outline used to appear between div elements when scrolling through the pages. I also fixed the formatting in last page.
- Created the footer and facts page. To do the facts page, I utilized bootstrap and its grid system, creating a header in 1 row and then 3 columns in the second row. The page shows images and information as to why someone should visit San Diego.
- The screenshot below show shows the facts page and the footer that I have implemented; The second screenshot shows the code I wrote using HTML/CSS.
