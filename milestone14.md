Paul Kim:
- I worked on making the application responsive as a whole by setting the width
and height of elements in the application to a percentage of the viewport width
and height.
- I added images to the popup message for the place markers on the map. When the
user hovers over a marker, the name and image of the place are displayed in the
popup.
- I changed the layout of each place in the list of SD Places. I removed
the address and kept the Map and Details button.
- I moved the Save button to the details modal because we thought it made more
sense for the user to save a place after viewing the details.
- I aligned the map and the places list.
- I created a Show/Hide Routing button that shows/hides the routing section on
the top-right of the map when it's clicked.
- I added tooltips to the buttons above the places list to show users what
those buttons do.
- I added a Details button to the marker popup that shows up when a place is
clicked on the map.
- I worked on fixing bugs and positioning elements in the right place.

Completed Features of Application

1) Save Feature
- A user can save places onto a list. There's a Save button in the details modal
of each place that the user can use to save it onto the list.

2) Routing
- A user can visualize a route from a start location to a destination on the map
and get directions in the routing section at the top-right of the map. The user
can either enter in addresses manually or click on a place marker on the map
to set it as a start location or destination.
