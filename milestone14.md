Team Member Work Done

Paul Kim:
- I worked on making the application responsive as a whole by setting the width
and height of elements in the application to a percentage of the viewport width
and height.
- I added images to the popup message for the place markers on the map. When the
user hovers over a marker, the name and image of the place are displayed in the
popup.
- I changed the layout of each place in the list of SD Places. I removed
the address and kept the Map and Details button.
- I moved the Save button to the details modal because we thought it made more
sense for the user to save a place after viewing the details.
- I aligned the map and the places list.
- I created a Show/Hide Routing button that shows/hides the routing section on
the top-right of the map when it's clicked.
- I added tooltips to the buttons above the places list to show users what
those buttons do.
- I added a Details button to the marker popup that shows up when a place is
clicked on the map.
- I worked on fixing bugs and positioning elements in the right place.

Judd Gatbonton:
- I worked on adding a bootstrap button on the homepage of the app and linked it to the About section. Button helps user know there is more to the app.
- I worked on making slight adjustments on the UI on the facts page.
- I helped work on positioning the Get Location button.
- I fixed the UI in the homepage and adjusted the fonts to make the title more visible.
- I also changed the image of the background of the homepage.
- I took out the unnecessary form in the nav bar and switched the About and Map links
- I put the facts page right after the homepage instead of the very end.

A user can visualize a route from a start location to a destination on the map
