When a user clicks on a marker for a location, the sidebar on the left displays detailed information
of that location such as the name, description, address, price, and category. Currently, it works
for a single marker only. For milestone 5, the application had a map with a few markers on it.
As of now, we have a map populated with a bunch of markers of popular locations in San Diego.
