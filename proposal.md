Description of what feedback taken from classmates/TA to settle on this idea:
Our team decided to settle on the Travel Guide idea, which incorporates core
elements from our Traveling and Event application ideas. We combined core
elements from our original ideas because The TA suggested designing and
developing a more holistic application that satisfies more than a single
specific need. In addition, we received positive feedback from classmates
regarding the Travel and Event application ideas, so we decided to take from
these ideas over other ones.

Description of proposed project's features:
- Takes input such as budget and trip duration to determine what cities the
user could travel to
- Displays an area or city's average price of hotels/housing, food,
transportation, and more on the map for the user to see on a map
- Displays popular landmarks and tourist spots in an area or city on a map
- Highlights areas or cities that the user could afford traveling to

Description of how programming work will be split:
Our team will split the programming work in a fair manner, so that each
member has an equivalent share of responsibility and work. We plan to
assign tasks and/or features to each member based on development experience
and technical skill set. We also plan to split the development work into
front-end and back-end potentially.
